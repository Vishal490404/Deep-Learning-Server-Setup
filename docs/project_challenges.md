## Resource Management
Currently, there are several limitations regarding resource allocation and management:

- **Storage Limits**: We currently have no mechanism to limit the amount of storage a person uses.
- **Custom Resources**: There is no way to provide custom memory and CPU allocations to specific users.
- **Default Quotas**: Currently, every user is provisioned with a default of:
    - **1 CPU**
    - **2 GB RAM**
